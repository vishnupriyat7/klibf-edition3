            The Kerala Legislature International Book Festival transcends socio economic cultural and political
            barriers. The festival is a celebration of democracy incorporating novel thoughts from progressive thinkers
            across the globe. Legislatures are law making bodies and this new tradition of conducting book festival by a
            legislature is a leap towards enhancement, the courage to think different. Our society vouches for evolution
            and transformation at a fast pace to improve the lives of the marginalised. Ground breaking ideas emanate
            from reading and unless the reading habit is nourished, our thought and vision will lose its sparkle. Let
            this Book Festival help to spread the light of knowledge. Let us pledge to make this world a better place to
            live. Together we can create a space of equality and alliance to learn and share new knowledge. I am sure
            the Kerala Legislature International Book Festival will be a significant milestone cherished by future
            generations.</p><br><br><br>
