                         I am thrilled to announce that the third edition of the prestigious Kerala Legislative
              International Book Festival (KLIBF) will take place from 2025 January 7 to 13, at the
              legislative complex in the historic capital of Kerala, Trivandrum. The previous editions were highly
              acclaimed for their public participation and the variety of cultural and artistic events. As part of the
              second edition, hundreds of books were distributed to village and school libraries, further
              establishing KLIBF as a renowned platform for celebrating the written word and an annual
              pilgrimage for book lovers of all ages.<br>
              Language and literature are the foundation of Kerala’s unique cultural identity. What defines
              Kerala’s original identity is its Malayalam language and the literature born from it. Originating in
              oral traditions, it evolved into inscriptions, manuscripts, print, and has now ventured into the digital
              age. Malayalam language and literature have a rich and profound history, and with the guidance of
              an outstanding array of poets and authors, they continue to spearhead modern literary development
              in India.<br>
              I invite everyone to the Kerala Niyamasabha fest, where in our land you can experience the
              vibes of Kathakali, traditional Sopana music, and the thrilling rhythms of Panchavadyam, Chenda
              Melam, and Thayambaka – a grand display of Kerala’s prestigious traditional musical instruments.
              The festival also features ancient writings on the science of architecture, such as Tantra
              Samuchayam and Shilpa Chandrika, celebrating Kerala's literary legacy over the centuries.
              On this occasion, I extend my heartfelt greetings and best wishes for the success of the third
              edition of the Kerala Niyamasabha International Book Festival.</p><br><br><br>
