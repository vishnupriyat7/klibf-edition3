                        The Kerala Legislature International Book Festival transcends socio-economic, cultural, and political
                        barriers. The festival is a celebration of democracy incorporating novel thoughts from progressive thinkers
                        across the globe.
                        <!-- Legislatures are law-making bodies, and this new tradition of conducting book festivals by
            a legislature is a leap towards enhancement, the courage to think differently. Our society vouches for
            evolution and transformation at a fast pace to improve the lives of the marginalized. Ground-breaking ideas
            emanate from reading, and unless the reading habit is nourished, our thought and vision will lose its
            sparkle. Let this Book Festival help spread the light of knowledge. Let us pledge to make this world a
            better place to live. Together, we can create a space of equality and alliance to learn and share new
            knowledge. I am sure the Kerala Legislature International Book Festival will be a significant milestone
            cherished by future generations. -->
